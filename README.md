## General info
This project is by Generator, a INFO30005 student team, based on the business requirements from Snacks in a Van, a startup company in Melbourne managing a fleet of mobile food trucks that operate as cafes. This operation involves creation of a web app for customers and vendors to use, viewable through vertical mobile devices and horizontal tablets. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* NodeJs 15.14.0
* npm 7.7.6

## Code Implementation

Include code connecting to database and the GET/POST request?

You can include a code snippet here.

```HTML
<!--
Example code from: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp
__>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Click the button to display an alert box.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("Hello! I am an alert box!");
}
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Adding Images

Image values contained in MongoDB are Strings. They point to images that are hosted on https://unsplash.com/. To open up the image, append the String to https://unsplash.com/photos/.

For example, to access "cappucinno" photos from menu that has String "T-kJRC_xqFI" in images, visit https://unsplash.com/photos/T-kJRC_xqFI


Or you can add your own images from a folder in your repo with the following code. The example has a folder `Gifs` with an image file `Q1-1.gif`:
```HTML
<p align="center">
  <img src="Gifs/Q1-1.gif"  width="300" >
</p>
```

To create a gif from a video you can follow this [link](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif/ezgif-6-55f4b3b086d4.mov).
